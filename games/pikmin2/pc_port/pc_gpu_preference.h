/*
 * Asking a switchable-graphics laptop for the dedicated GPU.
 *
 * On such a machine every process runs on the integrated GPU unless it asks
 * otherwise, and the port never asked: a GTX 1050 sat idle while the game
 * rendered on an HD 630. The two platforms want the request in different
 * forms and at different moments.
 *
 * Windows is handled in pc_main.cpp, not here. Both vendors read an exported
 * symbol out of the process image as it is loaded, before any code runs, so
 * there is nothing to decide at runtime.
 *
 * Linux is a runtime decision, and a dangerous one to get wrong.
 * __GLX_VENDOR_LIBRARY_NAME=nvidia on a machine with no NVIDIA GLX vendor
 * leaves libglvnd with no provider and OpenGL fails outright -- the fix would
 * break the game for everyone who does not have this hardware. So the choice
 * depends on what is actually installed, and the deciding is kept here, as a
 * pure function over that evidence, where it can be tested without a laptop.
 *
 * The three variables are NVIDIA's PRIME render offload protocol:
 *   __NV_PRIME_RENDER_OFFLOAD   ask for the discrete GPU at all
 *   __GLX_VENDOR_LIBRARY_NAME   route GLX to the NVIDIA vendor (X11, Xwayland)
 *   __EGL_VENDOR_LIBRARY_FILENAMES  the same for EGL (native Wayland)
 * GLX is requested automatically: X11 and Xwayland use it. Exclusive NVIDIA
 * EGL is not — pointing __EGL_VENDOR_LIBRARY_FILENAMES at 10_nvidia.json
 * alone makes SDL's Wayland path call eglGetDisplay on a vendor that cannot
 * talk to an Intel/AMD compositor, and the window never opens
 * ("Could not get EGL display"). Opt in with NECTAR_PRIME_EGL=1.
 *
 * AMD switchable graphics use DRI_PRIME instead and are NOT handled: that path
 * has no hardware here to verify it on, and an unverified guess is how the
 * integrated GPU was chosen in the first place.
